# Ruby On Rails

favourite, I tried out a lot other, a great choice, provides good productivity and developer experience, promotes end to end problemsolving
continously improving, pushing what is possible, has a great community, good docs, my opensource contribution, good books

Ruby on Rails is my framework of choice for building web applications. It enables imense productivity by giving developers a toolbox full of great tools like actionpack, activemodel, activerecord, that work together perfectly. Rails reduces boiler plate code to a minimum by utilizing the Ruby's elegant and human friendly syntax and metaprogramming capabilites.

My approach to working with Ruby on Rails is about staying as close to stock Ruby on Rails as possible, this way I can levarage most sinergy between the framework's components. I 'm not a fan of gems like [graphql](https://graphql-ruby.org/), which change how code is organized in a project. I prefer the fat models, skinny controllers guideline to organize code over creating services classes, I belive having an [expressive domain model](https://dev.37signals.com/domain-driven-boldness/) is a great asset.

I prefer to develop code using Test Driven Development, as it is described in [99 Bottles of OOP](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles). Using TDD is a good way to design clear interfaces and codify the requirements. I strive to provide the simplest solution to problems. I try to avoid speculating about future requirments and introducing unnecesarry abstractions to keep the codebase readable and maintainable.
